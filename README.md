# 🚀 Conversational AI with LangGraph, LangSmith, and LangChain

Welcome to the **Conversational AI Project**, where we harness the power of **LangGraph**, **LangSmith**, and **LangChain** to create a state-of-the-art chatbot. This project demonstrates how these advanced frameworks can be used to build intelligent, scalable, and efficient conversational agents capable of handling complex NLP tasks.

## 📝 Project Overview
In this project, we integrate three cutting-edge tools:
1. **LangGraph** - Helps in structuring and visualizing the flow of data within language models, making the AI's decision-making process more transparent and controllable.
2. **LangSmith** - Provides a highly customizable framework for crafting language models, allowing for refined control over AI responses and interaction flows.
3. **LangChain** - Enables the chaining of different language models and APIs, allowing for the creation of sophisticated pipelines for handling complex NLP tasks like text generation, summarization, and question-answering.

## 💡 Features
- **Graph-based NLP Pipelines**: Visualize the flow of data and decisions in your chatbot's interactions.
- **Custom Response Generation**: Fine-tune AI responses for different scenarios using LangSmith.
- **Task Automation**: Automate various NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, summarization, and more by chaining models using LangChain.
- **Seamless Model Integration**: Connect multiple language models for enhanced conversational abilities.


## 🛠️ Usage

To run the project:
1. Open the `ChatbotwithLanggraph.ipynb` notebook.
2. Follow the cells step-by-step to initialize and build the chatbot using LangGraph, LangSmith, and LangChain.
3. Customize the chatbot by experimenting with different models and chaining tasks.

### Example Use Case:
In this project, we built a chatbot that can handle:
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes large texts efficiently.
- **Question-Answering**: Responds to user queries based on pre-trained language models.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes user sentiment in real-time, adjusting responses accordingly.

## 🧑‍💻 Fine-Tuning the Model
You can fine-tune the pre-trained models provided by Hugging Face using LangSmith to create a custom conversational experience. The notebook guides you through:
1. **Model Selection**: Choose a model from Hugging Face’s library.
2. **Pipeline Creation**: Use LangGraph to visualize and structure your pipeline.
3. **Task Chaining**: Chain together tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation, and question-answering with LangChain.


## 🌐 Real-World Applications
This project can be applied to:
- **Smart Chatbots**: Develop dynamic, intelligent bots for customer support, virtual assistants, and more.
- **Document Summarization**: Create AI that summarizes lengthy documents quickly and accurately.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Build conversational agents that adapt to user sentiment in real-time.
